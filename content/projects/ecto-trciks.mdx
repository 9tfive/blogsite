Ecto, the database wrapper for Elixir, provides a rich set of features, and one of its gems is composable queries. Let's explore how composable queries in Ecto can enhance the readability and expressiveness of your database interactions.

## Introduction to Ecto and Composable Queries

Ecto allows you to build database queries using a composable and expressive syntax. Composable queries enable you to break down complex queries into smaller, reusable parts.

## Building a Composable Query

Consider a scenario where you need to fetch active users from the database:

```elixir
defmodule UserQueries do
  import Ecto.Query, warn: false

  def active_users_query do
    from u in User,
      where: u.active == true
  end
end
```
Now, you can use this query in various contexts:
```elixir
active_users = Repo.all(UserQueries.active_users_query)
```

This approach allows you to build and reuse composable queries throughout your application, promoting clarity and maintainability.

Leverage Ecto's composable queries to simplify your database interactions and build expressive queries in your Elixir projects!
