`Sigils` in Elixir are a powerful tool for working with different data types. In this guide, we'll dive into the enchanting realm of creating and documenting custom sigils to enhance your Elixir coding experience.

## Creating Custom Sigils

```elixir
defmodule MySigils do
  # Returns the downcased string; if option 'l' is given, returns the list of downcased letters
  def sigil_l(string, []), do: String.downcase(string)
  def sigil_l(string, [?l]), do: String.downcase(string) |> String.graphemes

  # Returns the upcased string; if option 'l' is given, returns the list of upcased letters
  def sigil_u(string, []), do: String.upcase(string)
  def sigil_u(string, [?l]), do: String.upcase(string) |> String.graphemes
end
```

These custom sigils (`~l` and `~u`) are designed to downcase or upcase a string, respectively. The magical part is that if the option `~l` is provided, they return a list of individual letters.

## Usage
Load the module into your IEx:
```elixir
iex> import MySigils
iex> ~l/HELLO/
"hello"
iex> ~l/HELLO/l
["h", "e", "l", "l", "o"]
iex> ~u/hello/
"HELLO"
iex> ~u/hello/l
["H", "E", "L", "L", "O"]
```

By creating and utilizing these custom sigils, you unlock a new level of expressiveness and convenience in your Elixir code. Documenting their usage ensures a seamless experience for both you and anyone who interacts with your magical Elixir spells.
