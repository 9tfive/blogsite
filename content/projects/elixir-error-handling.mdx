Elixir approaches error handling with a unique philosophy that sets it apart from other languages. Let's delve into the Zen of error handling in Elixir and understand its elegance.

## Introduction

In many languages, error handling involves the use of exceptions, which can lead to complex control flow and difficulties in reasoning about code. Elixir takes a different approach, emphasizing simplicity and predictability.

## Elixir Tuple Convention

Elixir embraces a tuple-based convention for handling results and errors. Functions return either `{:ok, result}` or `{:error, reason}`, providing a clear and consistent structure.

```elixir
defmodule ErrorHandlingExample do
  def divide(a, b) do
    if b == 0 do
      {:error, "Division by zero"}
    else
      {:ok, a / b}
    end
  end
end
```

By using this convention, error handling becomes explicit and allows for pattern matching, leading to more readable and maintainable code.

Embrace the Zen of error handling in Elixir, and let simplicity guide you through the graceful handling of unexpected situations.
