Mix tasks are a powerful tool in the Elixir ecosystem, allowing you to automate various development tasks. Let's explore how to create custom Mix tasks to enhance your Elixir projects.

## Introduction

Mix tasks are commands that can be run in the terminal to perform various tasks related to your Elixir project. While Mix comes with many built-in tasks, you can also create custom tasks to suit your specific needs.

## Creating a Custom Mix Task

Let's create a simple Mix task that greets the user:

```elixir
# lib/mix/tasks/greet.ex
defmodule Mix.Tasks.Greet do
  use Mix.Task

  def run(_) do
    IO.puts("Hello, Elixir Developer!")
  end
end
```
After creating the file, you can run your custom Mix task using:
```sh
mix greet
```

Creating custom Mix tasks allows you to extend your project's functionality in a clean and modular way.

Start mixing things up in your Elixir projects by creating custom Mix tasks tailored to your development workflow!
