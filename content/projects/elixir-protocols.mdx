In the world of Elixir, protocols serve as a gateway to achieve polymorphism and dynamic dispatch, allowing you to define and implement behaviors for different types. This guide will unveil the magic of Elixir protocols, demonstrating how to define them and provide implementations for diverse data types.

## Define a Protocol

To define a protocol, we use the `defprotocol` macro. Let's create a `Triple` protocol with a single function, `triple`:

```elixir
defprotocol Triple do
  def triple(input)
end
```

This protocol declares the `triple` function, and different types can provide their own implementations.

## Implement the Protocol
Now, let's implement the `Triple` protocol for two different types: `Integer` and `List`. We use the `defimpl` macro for this:
```elixir
defimpl Triple, for: Integer do
  def triple(int) do
    int * 3
  end
end

defimpl Triple, for: List do
  def triple(list) do
    list ++ list ++ list
  end
end
```
Here, we provide implementations for the `triple` function for both integers and lists.

## Usage
Load the code into IEx and witness the dynamic dispatch in action:
```elixir
iex> Triple.triple(3)
9

iex> Triple.triple([1, 2])
[1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2]
```
By calling `Triple.triple` with different types, Elixir dynamically dispatches to the appropriate implementation, showcasing the power and flexibility of protocols.

Embrace Elixir protocols to write more flexible and maintainable code, where behaviors can be extended for various data types without compromising clarity and coherence.
