OTP (Open Telecom Platform) is a set of tools and libraries bundled with Elixir that simplifies building robust, concurrent, and fault-tolerant systems. Let's harness the power of OTP by creating a basic GenServer for a practical scenario.

## Introduction to OTP

OTP provides abstractions for building reliable systems, and one of its key components is GenServer. A GenServer is a generic server that can be used to manage state and handle concurrent requests.

## Creating a Basic GenServer

Let's create a GenServer to manage a simple counter:

```elixir
defmodule CounterServer do
  use GenServer

  def start_link(_) do
    GenServer.start_link(__MODULE__, 0, name: __MODULE__)
  end

  def init(counter) do
    {:ok, counter}
  end

  def handle_call(:increment, _from, counter) do
    {:reply, counter + 1, counter + 1}
  end
end
```

Now, you can interact with your GenServer:

```elixir
{:ok, pid} = CounterServer.start_link
CounterServer.call(pid, :increment) # Returns {:ok, 1}
```

This basic example illustrates how OTP's GenServer simplifies the creation of concurrent and stateful components in your Elixir applications.

Harness the power of OTP and GenServer to build robust and concurrent systems in your Elixir projects!
